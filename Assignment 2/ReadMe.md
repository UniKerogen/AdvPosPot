**MIPS 2 Simple Calculator**

In this lab, you are supposed to write a program in MIPS, which can evaluate an algebraic expression entered by users from I/O window, and display the result to I/O window. 
Your program should be able to handle expression with a maximum of 4 operators, operands of up to 4 digits, at least 1 variable of 1 letter. 
Parentheses should be allowed in the expression. Your code should check for validity before evaluation. 
If the expression is not valid, then you just need to display “Invalid expression!” to the I/O window. 
our program should loop so that users can enter a new expression without re-assembling the code. 
You should comment your code.

**NOTICE**

1.  G file is only a demo for a possible approach of dealing with this problem. It is **NOT** finished and commented to some extent. Sub-functions are **NOT** included in the asm file. **_IT WILL NOT RUN AS A FINAL RESULT_**

2. U version of the file is genearlly working with negative not designed into the program and variable wiredly bugged out in U update.
