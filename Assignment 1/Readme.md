**Task 1: String copy**
	
Write a MIPS program to allow users to enter a string, which might be up to 64 byte long, via I/O window, and is saved to array X. The inputted string is then copied array X to array Y. You can manipulate the following procedure.



**Task 2: Factorial of a number**

Write a MIPS program that should be able to:
•	Display in the I/O window the prompt “Enter a number to find factorial: “
•	Take a number from the I/O window
•	Calculate the factorial of the number
•	Display the result to the I/O window starting with “Ans: “
You can use the procedure below to find the factorial of a number. 



**Task 3: Checking validity of an expression based on Matlab syntax**

You are supposed to write a MIPS program which checks for validity of a user-inputted expression via I/O window. The syntax for the expression should follow Matlab rules. Your program should display the prompt “>>>” for entering an expression of up to 64 symbols.  Expressions should include only parentheses, digits from 0 to 9, and letters from a to z (both upper and lower cases), operators +, -, *, /, and “=”. If there is error in an expression, display “Invalid input” in the I/O window; if there is no error, display “Valid input” in the I/O window.
Your program should loop so that users can enter new expressions without re-assembling the program. Your code should be commented.
